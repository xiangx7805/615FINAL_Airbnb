# 615FINAL_Airbnb

##Please wait for a while until all the graphs show~

There are three part for my [Final report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2hJfhXJVr-c2fOXAojArfRZB6VK4g0L).
1. the Shiny app  
   I have problem publishing the app. But it works well in the repository.
   And for the large dataset, it may take a while to show all graphs.
2. powerpoint generated by `officer`  
   Note: I made slight adjustment to ppt, without R officer.
3. Topic Model.  
   It is like an app and can be opened by browser, too.
   
I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who offered me help and suggestion to complete this app. 

A special gratitude I give to our dear professor, [Haviland Wright](https://github.com/havilandw).
